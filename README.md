# Data Mining Project
Proyect for Data Mining. Trained models with the objective to predict if a package will arrive on time or not. The dataset can be found on: https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics.


## Initial exploration files:
* ExploracionInicial.ipynb
* NOTES.txt
* Untitled.ipynb
* report.html

## General model files (not grouped by shipment mode): 
* ModelosGenerales.ipynb
* HyperparameterTuning.py (tuning the random forests)

## Models separated by shipment mode:
* main.ipynb (model metrics)
* main.py (same as main.ipynb but without metrics)
* FLIGHT-model.pkl
* ROAD-model.pkl
* SHIP-model.pkl

## Dataset 
* Train.csv

Note: there are only commits from two team members because we worked on shared units (Google Colabs) and through calls on a single file.
